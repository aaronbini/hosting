  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>
    Hosting Helper ("we", "our", or "us") is a meal planning tool that helps you plan
    menus and shopping lists for events. This policy explains how we handle your information.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you sign in with Google, we receive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name and email address (used to identify your account)</li>
    <li>A profile picture URL (displayed in the app)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you choose to connect Google Tasks or Google Sheets, we request access to those
    services solely to deliver your shopping list to them. We do not read or store any
    pre-existing data from your Tasks or Sheets.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also store the event details and meal plans you enter in the app so you can
    return to them later.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate you and associate your plans with your account</li>
    <li>To create Google Tasks lists or Google Sheets on your behalf, only when you
        explicitly request it</li>
    <li>To save and retrieve your event planning sessions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell, share, or use your data for advertising.</p>

  <h2>Google API Scopes</h2>
  <p>
    Hosting Helper's use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank">
      Google API Services User Data Policy
    </a>, including the Limited Use requirements.
  </p>
  <p>We request the following Google OAuth scopes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>openid, email, profile</strong> — to identify you when you sign in</li>
    <li><strong>Google Tasks</strong> — to create a shopping list task in your Google Tasks, only when you choose this output option</li>
    <li><strong>Google Sheets</strong> — to create a shopping list spreadsheet in your Google Drive, only when you choose this output option</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    Your data is stored in a secure database hosted on Google Cloud. We retain your
    event plans until you delete them. You can delete your data at any time from within
    the app.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We use Google Gemini to generate meal plans and shopping lists. Input you provide
    (event details, guest counts, dietary needs) is sent to Google's AI service to
    produce responses. Please review
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>
    for details on how they handle this data.
